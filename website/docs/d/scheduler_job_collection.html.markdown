# Data Source: azurerm_scheduler_job_collection

Use this data source to access information about an existing Scheduler Job Collection.

~> **NOTE:** Support for Scheduler Job Collections has been deprecated by Microsoft in favour of Logic Apps ([more information can be found at this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/scheduler/migrate-from-scheduler-to-logic-apps)) - as such we plan to remove support for this data source as a part of version 2.0 of the AzureRM Provider.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_scheduler_job_collection" "test" {
  name                = "tfex-job-collection"
  resource_group_name = "tfex-job-collection-rg"
}

output "job_collection_state" {
  value = "${data.azurerm_scheduler_job_collection.jobs.state}"
}
```
