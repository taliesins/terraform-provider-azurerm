-> **NOTE** Azure Firewall is currently in Public Preview.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "North Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" {
  name                = "testvnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "test" {
  name                 = "AzureFirewallSubnet"
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  virtual_network_name = "${azurerm_virtual_network.test.name}"
  address_prefix       = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip" "test" {
  name                         = "testpip"
  location                     = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name          = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  public_ip_address_allocation = "Static"
  sku                          = "Standard"
}

resource "azurerm_firewall" "test" {
  name                = "testfirewall"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "configuration"
    subnet_id                     = "${azurerm_subnet.test.id}"
    internal_public_ip_address_id = "${azurerm_public_ip.test.id}"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Firewall. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `ip_configuration` - (Required) A `ip_configuration` block as documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `ip_configuration` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the IP Configuration.

* `subnet_id` - (Required) Reference to the subnet associated with the IP Configuration.

-> **NOTE** The Subnet used for the Firewall must have the name `AzureFirewallSubnet` and the subnet mask must be at least `/25`.

* `internal_public_ip_address_id` - (Required) The Resource ID of the Public IP Address associated with the firewall.

-> **NOTE** The Public IP must have a `Static` allocation and `Standard` sku.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Resource ID of the Azure Firewall.

* `ip_configuration` - A `ip_configuration` block as defined below.

---

A `ip_configuration` block exports the following:

* `private_ip_address` - The private IP address of the Azure Firewall.

## Import

Azure Firewalls can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_firewall.test /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls/testfirewall
```
