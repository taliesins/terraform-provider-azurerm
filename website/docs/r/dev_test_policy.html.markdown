  name                = "example-devtestlab"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"

    "Sydney" = "Australia"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_dev_test_policy" "test" {
  name                = "LabVmCount"
  policy_set_name     = "default"
  lab_name            = "${azurerm_dev_test_lab.test.name}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
