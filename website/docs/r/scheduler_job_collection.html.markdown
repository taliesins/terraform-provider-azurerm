# azurerm_scheduler_job_collection

Manages a Scheduler Job Collection.

~> **NOTE:** Support for Scheduler Job Collections has been deprecated by Microsoft in favour of Logic Apps ([more information can be found at this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/scheduler/migrate-from-scheduler-to-logic-apps)) - as such we plan to remove support for this resource as a part of version 2.0 of the AzureRM Provider.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "tfex-job_collection"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_scheduler_job_collection" "jobs" {
  name                = "example_job_collection"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.name}"
  sku                 = "free"
  state               = "enabled"

  quota {
    max_job_count            = 5
    max_recurrence_interval  = 24
    max_recurrence_frequency = "hour"
  }
}
```
