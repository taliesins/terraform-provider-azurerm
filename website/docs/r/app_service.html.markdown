# azurerm_app_service

Manages an App Service (within an App Service Plan).

-> **Note:** When using Slots - the `app_settings`, `connection_string` and `site_config` blocks on the `azurerm_app_service` resource will be overwritten when promoting a Slot using the `azurerm_app_service_active_slot` resource.

## Example Usage (.net 4.x)

```hcl
resource "random_id" "server" {
  keepers = {
    azi_id = 1
  }

  byte_length = 8
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "some-resource-group"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "test" {
  name                = "some-app-service-plan"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"

  sku {
    tier = "Standard"
    size = "S1"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_app_service" "test" {
  name                = "${random_id.server.hex}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  app_service_plan_id = "${azurerm_app_service_plan.test.id}"

  site_config {
    dotnet_framework_version = "v4.0"
    scm_type                 = "LocalGit"
  }

  app_settings {
    "SOME_KEY" = "some-value"
  }

  connection_string {
    name  = "Database"
    type  = "SQLServer"
    value = "Server=some-server.mydomain.com;Integrated Security=SSPI"
  }
}
```

```hcl
resource "random_id" "server" {
  keepers = {
    azi_id = 1
  }

  byte_length = 8
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "some-resource-group"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "test" {
  name                = "some-app-service-plan"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"

  sku {
    tier = "Standard"
    size = "S1"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_app_service" "test" {
  name                = "${random_id.server.hex}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  app_service_plan_id = "${azurerm_app_service_plan.test.id}"

  site_config {
    java_version           = "1.8"
    java_container         = "JETTY"
    java_container_version = "9.3"
    scm_type               = "LocalGit"
  }
