# azurerm_storage_account

Manage an Azure Storage Account.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "testrg" {
  name     = "resourceGroupName"
  location = "westus"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "testsa" {
  name                     = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name      = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.name}"
  location                 = "westus"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"

  tags {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with Network Rules

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "testrg" {
  name     = "resourceGroupName"
  location = "westus"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" {
  name                = "virtnetname"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.name}"
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "test" {
  name                 = "subnetname"
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.name}"
  virtual_network_name = "${azurerm_virtual_network.test.name}"
  address_prefix       = "10.0.2.0/24"
  service_endpoints    = ["Microsoft.Sql", "Microsoft.Storage"]
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "testsa" {
  name                = "storageaccountname"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.name}"

  location                 = "${azurerm_resource_group.testrg.location}"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"

  network_rules {
    ip_rules                   = ["127.0.0.1"]
    virtual_network_subnet_ids = ["${azurerm_subnet.test.id}"]
  }

  tags {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the storage account. Changing this forces a
    new resource to be created. This must be unique across the entire Azure service,
    not just within the resource group.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
    create the storage account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the
    resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `account_kind` - (Optional) Defines the Kind of account. Valid options are `Storage`,
    `StorageV2` and `BlobStorage`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    Defaults to `Storage`.

* `account_tier` - (Required) Defines the Tier to use for this storage account. Valid options are `Standard` and `Premium`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created

* `account_replication_type` - (Required) Defines the type of replication to use for this storage account. Valid options are `LRS`, `GRS`, `RAGRS` and `ZRS`.

* `access_tier` - (Optional) Defines the access tier for `BlobStorage` and `StorageV2` accounts. Valid options are `Hot` and `Cool`, defaults to `Hot`.

* `enable_blob_encryption` - (Optional) Boolean flag which controls if Encryption Services are enabled for Blob storage, see [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-service-encryption/) for more information. Defaults to `true`.

* `enable_file_encryption` - (Optional) Boolean flag which controls if Encryption Services are enabled for File storage, see [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-service-encryption/) for more information. Defaults to `true`.

* `enable_https_traffic_only` - (Optional) Boolean flag which forces HTTPS if enabled, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-require-secure-transfer/)
    for more information.

* `account_encryption_source` - (Optional) The Encryption Source for this Storage Account. Possible values are `Microsoft.Keyvault` and `Microsoft.Storage`. Defaults to `Microsoft.Storage`.

* `custom_domain` - (Optional) A `custom_domain` block as documented below.

* `network_rules` - (Optional) A `network_rules` block as documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `identity` - (Optional) A Managed Service Identity block as defined below.

---

* `custom_domain` supports the following:

* `name` - (Optional) The Custom Domain Name to use for the Storage Account, which will be validated by Azure.
* `use_subdomain` - (Optional) Should the Custom Domain Name be validated by using indirect CNAME validation?

---

* `network_rules` supports the following:

* `bypass` - (Optional)  Specifies whether traffic is bypassed for Logging/Metrics/AzureServices. Valid options are
any combination of `Logging`, `Metrics`, `AzureServices`, or `None`. 
* `ip_rules` - (Optional) List of IP or IP ranges in CIDR Format. Only IPV4 addresses are allowed.
* `virtual_network_subnet_ids` - (Optional) A list of resource ids for subnets.

~> **Note:** [More information on Validation is available here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/blobs/storage-custom-domain-name)

---

`identity` supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the identity type of the Storage Account. At this time the only allowed value is `SystemAssigned`.

~> The assigned `principal_id` and `tenant_id` can be retrieved after the identity `type` has been set to `SystemAssigned`  and Storage Account has been created. More details are available below.

`identity` exports the following:

* `principal_id` - The Principal ID for the Service Principal associated with the Identity of this Storage Account.

* `tenant_id` - The Tenant ID for the Service Principal associated with the Identity of this Storage Account.

-> You can access the Principal ID via `${azurerm_storage_account.test.identity.0.principal_id}` and the Tenant ID via `${azurerm_storage_account.test.identity.0.tenant_id}`

## Import

Storage Accounts can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_storage_account.storageAcc1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myaccount
```
